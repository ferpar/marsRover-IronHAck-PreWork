Game concepts:

    -Achieve goals in a limited time
        --> Possibly pickup certain items ala "Packman"

    Multiplayer: 
        a) Second player needs to intercept first one before achieving said goal (controls other than wasd)
            --> Modify abilities of each role to make for a more engaging experience
        b) Players must beat each other at picking up the most items
            --> Bots "trying to intercept" players could be added
